            <h2>CITIES AVIV</h2>
            <p>
                I’ve been listening to a ton of Cities Aviv lately and I strongly urge anyone who hasn’t to take a look at his stuff. He just dropped a new album called MAN PLAYS THE HORN and it’s up there with his best projects. It’s an insanely beautiful and unique breed of experimental hiphop that makes you feel like youre floating over and over again. He’s got something for everyone, with albums like Immortal Flame and GUM for when you just wanna chill with something a little more interesting to listen to, or Come to Life and Black Pleasure for when you want something heavier, and The Crashing Sound of How it Goes and the aforementioned MAN PLAYS THE HORN for when you want something with range. His music scratches an itch I didn’t know I had. My fav tracks right now are Cinema Club, Buy Time, Higher Up There, and the 45 minute craziness that is Power Approaches. -DJ BALLS

            <h2>CLARENCE CLARITY</h2>
            <p>
                Idk how to put into words that music can evoke a feeling that’s beyond just enjoyment of sound but Clarence Clarity’s music does that for me. He’s a prime example of an artist I liked a song from and then somehow forgot about only to become obsessed with them later. Listening to songs like Will to Believe feels being a glass resonating with a singer’s voice at the very brink of shattering. It’s something else entirely for me and finding stuff that creates that resonance doesn’t happen often. It’s kinda crazy, but I definitely recommend his debut album No NOW if you do give it a listen. -DJ BALLS
