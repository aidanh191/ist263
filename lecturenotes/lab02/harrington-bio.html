        <h1>Aidan Harrington's Bio</h1>
        <h2>Personal Info</h2>

        <p>I'm a junior in the iSchool majoring in <strong>Information Management and Technology</strong> with a concentration in <strong>Web Design</strong> and a design minor to match. I'm interested in creating intuitive ways to interact with technology and the internet, to lower the perceived barriers to entry the world of tech can have to people. 
        I picked the concentration and minor last semester, so I haven't made any major accomplishments yet, but I helped a local barbershop run their instagram page for a semester using knowledge from IST 486 to create a measurable increase in engagement and follower count. </p>

        <h2>Hobbies/Interests</h2>
        <p> As far as my own hobbies and interests go, I love fashion, music, art, design of all kinds, and skateboarding on and off (when I'm in an apartment that isn't on a hill). I'm a moderator of the online community for the clothing brand Cactus Plant Flea Market, and we have something like 2500 members as of now. Being a part of that community, I also have way too big a collection of their clothes. My favorite music artists right now are Slauson Malone, Cities Aviv, Clarence Clarity, and my favorite of all time is R.A.P. Ferreira, formerly known as Milo. I also play a lot of Destiny 2 and used to play a lot of World of Warcraft.</p>
       

        <p>I also really enjoy talking to/working with people, and I worked at Five Below for 3 years before being promoted to a manager position at another store which I did for 1.5 years but left due to unfortunate staffing issues that led to me working more than I could handle as a student. Before Five Below, I worked in the Syracuse City School District doing childcare for parent events, which I did for one year while in high school. Some of my strengths from my work experience are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining accurate cash counts while interacting with customers in a busy retail environment</li>
            <li>Providing great customer service and helping people however I can</li>
            <li>Creating measurable increases in metrics such as email and survey capture rates</li>
            <li>Troubleshooting equipment issues and multitasking while keeping the store running smoothly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My goal is to find my place in the tech industry where I can make a tangible difference for people by making things easy for them, and to make everyone a little more confident.</p>
