        Hi there, my name is Aidan Harrington. 

        I’m a junior majoring in Information Management and Technology with a concentration in web design and a design minor to match. I’m interested in creating intuitive ways to interact with technology and the internet, to lower the perceived barriers to entry the world of tech can have to people. 
        I picked the concentration and minor last semester, so I haven’t made any major accomplishments yet, but I helped a local barbershop run their instagram page for a semester using knowledge from IST 486 to create a measurable increase in engagement and follower count. 
        As far as my own hobbies and interests go, I love fashion, music, art, design of all kinds, and skateboarding on and off (when I’m in an apartment that isn’t on a hill). I’m a moderator of the online community for the clothing brand Cactus Plant Flea Market, and we have something like 2500 members as of now. My favorite music artists right now are Slauson Malone, Cities Aviv, Clarence Clarity, and my favorite of all time is R.A.P. Ferreira, formerly known as Milo. I also play a lot of Destiny 2 and used to play a lot of World of Warcraft.
        I also really enjoy talking to/working with people, and I worked at Five Below for 3 years before being promoted to a manager position at another store which I did for 1.5 years but quit due to unfortunate staffing issues that led to me working more than I could handle as a student.. My goal is to find my place in the tech industry where I can make a tangible difference for people by making things they can interact with easily and seamlessly, and make everyone a little more confident.
